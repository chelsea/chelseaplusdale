        <h2>Details</h2>

        <p>When: November 25, 2017 (exact times TBD)</p>
        <p>Where: NSW, Australia</p>

        <h2>Getting here</h2>
        <h4>International</h4>
        There are three main options for flights, you can fly to Sydney or Melbourne and rent a car (or take a very long busy trip) to drive around 7 hours to our place.
        Alternatively, you can fly to Canberra from Sydney or Melbourne and have a 3 hour drive to our place. A more expensive but time saving option is to fly into
        Merimbula with <a href="http://rex.com.au">Rex</a>, however this is small regional airline with tight baggage limits, limited schedule, and expensive flights.

        <h4>From Australia</h4>
        For flights (Perth is pretty much international!), see the details for international visitors.<br/>
        Driving from Sydney you can take the scenic, shorter, but more variable (more traffic hold ups, speed limits drop to 50km/h) coast road, or head inland along the Hume via Canberra. The Hume will be a bit longer, but a more straightforward drive. We'd recommend taking the scenic coast road if you haven't before.
        <br/>
        We'll be making trips in and out of Bega and Merimbula/Pambula leading up to the wedding and should be able to co-ordinate pick ups from buses or the airpor there as needed.

        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        We'll be doing our best to arrange a bus, shuttle, or some other form of transport for guests on the day of the wedding from/to Merimbula, as the accommodation options there are much better than in Pambula as are the general attractions for out of towners.<br/>
        We'll also have an area for camping on the property, however we ask that aside from the wedding day you come prepared to be self sufficient with food, water, etc.

        <h2>On the day</h2>
        Our wedding is going to be on the informal side, and outdoors. We'll have a marquee tent for some shade and general shelter, the weather in November is typically quite nice during the day with possibly a cooler evening.
        <br/>
        Events will kick off around lunch time, with the ceremony scheduled for some time that day.
        <br/>
        We'll be roasting a pig on a spit (maybe also a lamb) for the meals, please let us know in advance if this is an issue and we can sort out alternative mains as needed.

        <h2>RSVP Online</h2>
        Sorry, we couldn't source stamps for returning RSVPs from Canada, if you'd prefer to RSVP online please fill out this form for us:
